Faith is what I have in our future, which is a substance for things to hope for; it becomes evidence for things not seen. You might not have it, but you have the knowledge to achieve it. Continue to do more and leave things for the next generation!\u201dReflecting on Smith and Carlos Day at Smith and Carlos Lawn! A big shout out to the incredible Dr. Tommie Smith for his inspiration. Thank you to the C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Community Action Center for all your hard work in making this day truly special!

As an Olympic Gold medalist, Dr. Smith shared invaluable insights from his extraordinary journey.\u201cI\u2019ve lost two races in my life, and both were to John Carlos! But you know what? He can outrun me! I see a bit of him in each of you looking out at this room at all of you students.\u201dThank you to everyone who made the day possible. It will be one to remember for SJSU.#TommieSmith #Inspiration #SJSUPride #SmithAndCarlosDaysjsu8dExciting news, future Spartans!

            "id:j-column-4": "sjsu4d\u201cThe Day of the Dead is certainly a time to remember and reflect, but it's also a time to recall the joy in life,\u201d says Kathryn Blackmer Reyes, \u201996 MLIS, director of the Africana, Asian American, Chicano, and Native American (AAACNA) Studies Center at King Library. She has coordinated the annual Art of Remembrance in honor of D\u00eda de los Muertos at the library for more than 15 years.\u201cMourning our loved ones is difficult, but it also allows us to give thanks by giving them our time, however long that might be,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd sometimes all it takes is five minutes. With this exhibit, I hope people enjoy the art, the presentation, the conversation that the artists/creators are presenting, and also the conversation they might have with others.\u201dRead more about upcoming festivities, including the 27th annual D\u00eda de los Muertos procession and festival on Oct. 20, on the SJSU NewsCenter blog.PreviousNextsjsu6d\ud83c\udf1f What a fantastic evening with Bryan Ford @artisanbryan! He truly brought the art of baking to life, beautifully describing his blend of Latin American traditions with artisanal sourdough techniques.Listening to his journey, professional insights, and genuine connection with the audience was both entertaining and inspiring. The sneak peeks from Bryan's upcoming book, Pan y Dulce\u2014\u201ca love letter to Latin America,\u201d as he describes it\u2014had everyone buzzing with excitement.A big thank you to those who joined us for the Latinx Heritage Month Featured Speaker event in the Student Union Ballroom, especially @CENTRO_SJSU and @thebloc_sjsu for making it happen! It was a night filled with delicious stories and vibrant conversation. Here\u2019s to many more memorable events like this! \ud83c\udf5e\u2728#SJSU #BryanFord #SJSULikesBakedGoods #LatinxHeritageMonthsjsu8dSJSU recently hosted U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Xavier Becerra, who toured campus alongside President Cynthia Teniente-Matson and other campus leaders, as well as Society of Latino Engineers and Scientists (SOLES) President Antonio Hueso-Fernandez, \u201825 Mechanical Engineering, and CSU Student Trustee and CSU Channel Islands student Jazmin Guajardo.Hueso-Fernandez found the secretary\u2019s visit to be \u201ca truly impactful moment, not just for me but for my family as well. In less than two generations, our family's journey has gone from working in agricultural fields to introducing Secretary Becerra during Hispanic Heritage Month and soon graduating from SJSU's College of Engineering with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I want him to know that while SJSU has made incredible strides in increasing the number of Hispanic and Latino students in STEM, there is still much work to be done.\u201dFor this and more student perspectives, as well as details about the new ARPA-H Emerging Health Innovators (EHI) Initiative, read the story on our NewsCenter."
